# Datapos - File Store Emulator Data Connector

A TypeScript library that implements the File Store Emulator data connector by Datapos. It provides easy access to a curated set of files for demonstration and evaluation purposes.

## Installation

The Datapos Operations library contains helper functions to upload connectors to the Datapos hosting platform. A developer account is required to access this functionality. Once uploaded, the Datapos engine will automatically retrieve the connector associated with a given connection at runtime.
